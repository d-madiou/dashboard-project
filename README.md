# Dashboard Project

I built this dashboard project from scratch using the intermediate knowledge I gained in CSS and HTML through the Odin course. Thanks to some colleagues in the Odin community for helping me debug certain errors by reviewing their projects.

This dashboard contains a sidebar, header, and content container:
- In the sidebar, you can see the options for the dashboard.
- In the header, you can access the search bar, profile, and various other buttons.
- In the content section, there are different cards showcasing my previous projects, an announcement section, and a trends card.
